# Anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine
####
  Billions of dollars of loss are caused every year due to fraudulent credit card transactions. The
design of efficient fraud detection algorithms is key for reducing these losses, and more algorithms
rely on advanced machine learning techniques to assist fraud investigators. The design of fraud
detection algorithms is however particularly challenging due to non-stationary distribution of the
data, highly imbalanced classes distributions and continuous streams of transactions. At the same
time public data are scarcely available for confidentiality issues, leaving unanswered many
questions about which is the best strategy to deal with them. . 
               
   The analysis is made possible by a real credit card dataset provided
by our industrial partner. In this project, we attempt to develop and evaluate a model for the
imbalanced credit card fraud dataset.
